# Project Overview

In this project, I had to build 4 Jasmine test suites in order to ensure the functionality of the blog. Jasmine was already built into the project.

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

## How to Run

Clone or downlonload in your computer. Then, navigate to and open index.html
